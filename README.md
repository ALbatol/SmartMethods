# SmartMethods
Using SLAM map to launch the navigation 

First, I went to https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/nav_simulation/ and copied the commands to launch gazebo. 
Then, I have opned a new terminal in order to launch the map.yaml file in the turtlebot3 navigator as shown.

After that, I have opened a third terminal to run the command "ristopic echo /move_base_simple/goal" in order to determine the position and the orientation. 
Then, i clicked on 2D Nav Goal and picked a target point that the turtlebot should head for automariclally as shown.
