Use Turlebot with SLAM approach ro create and save map...

First, I visit the websit https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/ to setup my PC by installing dependenties packages for the melodic ROS.
Then, I started with the simulation process by also installing the simulation packages.
I start out by launching Gazebo so i can launch SLAM in Gazebo simulator.
